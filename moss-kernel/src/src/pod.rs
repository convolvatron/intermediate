/// An unsafe trait indicating that a type is "Plain Old Data".
///
/// A type is `Pod` if it is a simple collection of bytes with no invalid bit
/// patterns. This means it can be safely created by simply copying its byte
/// representation from memory or a device.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The implementor of this trait MUST guarantee that:
/// 1. The type has a fixed, known layout. Using `#[repr(C)]` or
///    `#[repr(transparent)]` is a must! The Rust ABI is unstable.
/// 2. The type contains no padding bytes, or if it does, that reading those
///    padding bytes as uninitialized memory is not undefined behavior.
/// 3. All possible bit patterns for the type's size are valid instances of the type.
///    For example, a `bool` is NOT `Pod` because its valid representations are only
///    0x00 and 0x01, not any other byte value. A `u32` is `Pod` because all
///    2^32 bit patterns are valid `u32` values.
