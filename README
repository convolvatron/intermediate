This project is a prototype for intermediating syscalls for purposes of distributed
evaluation, policy expression, packaging, and recasting the environment of existing
service binaries.

It uses a fairly heavyweight implementation where processes are wrapped in a proxy
kernel (linux_proxy and arm64_kernel) run as a virtual machine by a hypervisor monitor
which proxies the actual services of the host.

The client side (proxy kernel) is derived form the
https://github.com/hexagonal-sun/moss-kernel, with heavy and fairly gratuitous
modifications. Modifications which should be considered as suggested changes to
moss itself, its just that the intent here is somewhat different.

In the process we lost thread support. it wasn't entirely there, but now we look more
like BSD on a 68k.
